# Kaazing JavaScript Starter Applications

This Kaazing JavaScript Starter Applications project provides skeleton applications that can be used to develop new client applications that leverage the Kaazing WebSocket Gateway.

There are three starter apps covering three popular front-end frameworks:

- jQuery
- AngularJS v1.x
- ReactJS

These applications all use the [Kaazing JavaScript Universal Client Library](https://github.com/kaazing/universal-client/tree/develop/javascript)

Please feel free to submit pull requests for additional frameworks (ex: Angular2)!
